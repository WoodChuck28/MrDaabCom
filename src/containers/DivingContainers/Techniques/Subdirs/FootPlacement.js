            <h3>Hurdle Foot Placement</h3>
            <p>
                Now, let’s consider the question of where to place the front plant foot in the last step. 
                A rule of thumb used to be to place the last step where the rivets on the board stop but 
                that is too far back from the end of the board. The modern springboard is more tapered and 
                hence more flexible closer to the tip, so placing the foot more toward the end of the board 
                allows for greater depression of the board, especially if the diver’s weight is over the last 
                step on contact. Approximately 8 inches (20 cm) from the end of the springboard is appropriate 
                for most divers. This distance will vary slightly among divers.

                Hurdle consistency is achieved by doing the same things every time. So, placing the last step the 
                same distance from the board each time will greatly increase hurdle consistency. To make this exact 
                placement, divers must train their eyes to watch the placement of their last step. Training the eyes 
                is especially helpful so that in competition divers’ eyes don’t wander to some external irrelevant 
                cue such as the crowd. Many coaches mistakenly teach their divers to look straight ahead or out at 
                the water during the approach. Elite divers watch where they place their first step; then they watch 
                where they place their last step before shifting their focus and looking at the tip of the board during 
                the hurdle decent until about 3 or 4 inches (7 to 10 cm) from contact. This focal point makes sense 
                because getting to the tip of the board is critical. A dive is easy when the diver lands on the end 
                of the springboard. Conversely, a dive is more difficult when the diver lands far back or far over the 
                tip of the springboard.

                To foster consistency in foot placement for the last step, the coach or diver can wrap athletic tape 
                around the springboard approximately 8 inches (20 cm) from the tip of the board. This gives the diver 
                a specific target to aim at for foot placement in the last step. For even greater precision, a piece 
                of athletic tape about the length of the diver’s foot can be taped to the board exactly where the foot 
                will be planted in the last step. On each forward approach, the diver should try to place the foot 
                directly over the tape.
