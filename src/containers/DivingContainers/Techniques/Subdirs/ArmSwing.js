            <h3>The Walk</h3>
            <p>The arm swing, as you might guess, involves moving the arms in synchronization with each step in the walk. 
                The arm swing is easy to syncopate with the steps. If the diver takes five steps, the arms move backward 
                as the first step is taken. If diver takes four steps, the arms move forward as the first step is taken. 
                Many divers and diving coaches overlook the importance of the arm swing, focusing more on what happens at 
                the end of the approach than on what happens at the beginning. Of course, both are important; however, even 
                though the arm swing may seem like a simple and unassuming element of the forward approach, it is more 
                critical than divers and coaches might first think.</p> 
                
            <p>
                The diving board is like a stringed musical instrument 
                with its own vibration and rhythm, and the diver must be in rhythm with the board. The board won’t 
                accommodate the diver; the diver must accommodate the board. In other words, the diver’s rhythm must 
                match the board’s rhythm. At a U.S. national championship, one of my divers had a disastrous event on 
                the 1-meter springboard, pounding the board with every hurdle and finishing in last place. In a 
                late-evening practice, I asked him to focus on swinging his arms and finding more rhythm in his approach. 
                That did the trick. In the next day’s event, the 3-meter springboard, he caught the board at its apex with 
                every hurdle and made finals. 
            </p>
                
            <p>
                When swinging the arms in the approach, the diver must remember to disengage 
                the trapezius muscles so that the arms swing freely. A big part of diving is learning which muscles to 
                engage and which to disengage during motor performance.

            <p>
                The last step is when the diver plants the foot (i.e., the drive leg that propels the diver up 
                into the hurdle) in preparation to hurdle to the end of the board. There are two critical 
                components of the last step to pay attention to because they directly influence the quality 
                of the subsequent hurdle. The first is to swing the arms back early enough in the last step 
                so that they pause before swinging forward (figure 2.4). The arms then swing forward as the 
                last step is taken. Many divers swing their arms back much too late, waiting until they plant 
                their last step to begin swinging the arms forward. Even great divers make this mistake. 
            </p>
            <p>
                World champion Russian diver Aleksandr Dobroskok, for example, during his up-and-down 
                (no pun intended) career, occasionally found himself over the tip of the board in some 
                competitions because his arm swing was much too late on his last step. In some competitions, 
                in fact, he was so far over the end of the board that he failed the dive.
            </p>

                <img style={{maxHeight: "300px", maxWidth: "500px"}} src="./finalAS.PNG" alt ="finalAS"></img>
            </div>
            <p>
                Unless the diver has good shoulder flexibility, it is easier to bring the arms back wide so the 
                shoulders aren’t pulled back causing the diver to lean backward. For the other steps in the approach, 
                the arm swing should be much shorter. 
            </p>
            <p>
                The first essential position for the springboard forward approach 
                is that all or nearly all of the body weight should be over the front foot immediately on contact with 
                the board in the last step. This placement allows the diver to depress the board maximally. 
                Many divers make the mistake of leaning backward as they place their last step (often because they get 
                their arms back too late in the last step and then are afraid of jumping over the end of the board in 
                their hurdle, like Dobroskok) and then transferring their weight to the front leg. This approach might 
                guarantee that they won’t be over the end of the board in their hurdle, but it also guarantees that 
                they won’t maximally load (i.e., depress) the board to create a good hurdle. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Because they depress the board so deeply, many elite male divers stay over their last step but 
                then sit back slightly in the last step. Notice that in the last step the arms are near the hips 
                when the foot contacts the board.
