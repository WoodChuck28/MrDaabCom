            <h3>The Hurdle</h3>
            <p>The hurdle involves jumping off one leg after the last step while raising the knee 
                of the opposite leg. The five key elements of the hurdle are early arm swing, high 
                knee, step-down position, contact position, and magic position. The following 
                sections describe these elements. The second essential position for the springboard 
                forward approach is to swing the arms to approximately 12 o’clock in the last step 
                when the board is fully or nearly fully depressed. This is one of the most critical 
                positions for performing a consistent hurdle: arms up when the board is down in the 
                last step. Unfortunately, it is one of the biggest mistakes many divers make in the 
                hurdle. They make this mistake because many diving coaches don’t teach this technique 
                and because it seems intuitively natural toswing the arms up as the board comes up. 
                Figure 2.6 depicts this all-important early arm swing position into the hurdle.

          <p>
            Swinging the arms up when the board is down in the last step helps establish a vertical jump 
            into the hurdle rather than a horizontal jump, which causes the diver to land over the end of 
            the board. Generally, two movements produce a vertical hurdle: the early arm swing in the last 
            step and a high knee in the hurdle.
          </p>
          <p>
            The hurdle knee is the knee that is raised and bent during the jump (hurdle) to the end of the 
            board. The diver must lift the knee high enough to achieve approximately a 90-degree angle between 
            the thigh and the upper body. Many divers step down too early and therefore never achieve the correct 
            angle with the hurdle knee. The correct position of the hurdle knee is shown in figure 2.7.

        <p>
          The 90-degree hurdle position is less critical and arguably not quite as essential to the forward approach. 
          Video analysis indicates that a number of elite springboard divers do not lift the knee quite high enough 
          to achieve a 90-degree angle. This is particularly true for some elite female divers, perhaps because they 
          do not depress the board as far as some male divers. However, two divers who possessed quintessential 
          hurdles—U.S. female diver Christina Loukas and Russian male diver Dmitri Sautin—achieve 90-degree angles 
          in their hurdles.
        </p>
        <p>
            When it comes to the position of the hurdle foot, however, there is no debate. All elite springboard divers 
            keep the hurdle foot back when lifting and lowering it during the hurdle. The third essential position, then, 
            is keeping the hurdle foot back so that it slides along the opposite leg when raised and lowered. Figure 2.8 
            indicates the correct position of the hurdle foot while being raised and lowered.
